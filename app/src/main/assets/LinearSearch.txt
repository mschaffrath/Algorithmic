Here we will show you Linear Search, one of the algorithms used to search elements in an array.
Let's try searching for the number 6.
First, we examine the leftmost number at index 'i'.
We compare it with 6, and if it matches, the search ends. If it doesn't match, we examine the next number to the right.
We repeat the comparisons until the 6 is found.
We found the 6, so the search ends.
As you can see, linear search is a simple technique for doing repeated comparisons in order from the beginning.
When there's a lot of data, the number of comparisons increases, and it takes more time.
This concludes the explanation of linear search.
