Here we will show you Insertion Sort, one of the many algorithms used to sort an array of numbers.
To begin, the leftmost number is considered fully sorted.
Next, from the remaining numbers the leftmost number is taken out and compared to the already sorted number to its left.
If the already sorted set is larger, the two numbers swap.
This operation repeats until either a smaller number appears, or the number reaches the left edge.
In this case, 5 is greater than 3, so the numbers swap.
3 reached the left edge, so the number stops moving.
The 3 is now considered fully sorted.
As before, the leftmost number from the remaining numbers is taken out and compared to the number to its left.
5 is greater than 4, so the numbers swap.
3 is less than 4. A smaller number appeared, so the 4 stops moving.
The 4 is now considered fully sorted.
The same operation is repeated until all of the numbers are fully sorted.
All of the numbers are fully sorted, so sorting is complete.
This concludes the explanation of insertion sort.
