Here we will show you Bubble Sort, one of the many algorithms used to sort an array of numbers.
'j' and 'k' will iterate through the array and compare their elements until the 'i' index which currently is at the end.
The highlighted elements in the array will follow 'j' and 'k' as they iterate.
So, for the first step we will compare the value of 3 and 4. If 3 is greater than 4, we swap them. If not, nothing happens. Let's begin by pressing the "Next" button!
As you can see, nothing happened since 3 is not greater than 4. Now 'j' and 'k' will be incremented by 1.
Now we will compare 4 and 6.
Since 4 is less than 6, nothing happened once again.
Now we will compare 6 and 7.
Since 6 is less than 7, nothing happened.
Now we will compare 7 and 1. Since 7 is greater than 1 you will see them swap.
Since 7 is the largest number it will eventually be placed at the end where 'i' is located after a full iteration.
After an entire iteration, 'i' will be decremented by 1 and the other indices will return to the beginning.
The same operations are repeated until all of the numbers are fully sorted.
Sorting is complete.
This concludes the explanation of Bubble Sort.
